A Vagrantfile is a configuration file used with Vagrant, a tool for managing and provisioning virtualized development environments.

The Vagrantfile defines various aspects of the virtual machine environment, such ~as the base box~, ~networking~, and ~provisioning~.

1. Vagrant Configuration Block:
        Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
            # All Configuration settings go here
        end
    
    This is the main configuration block where all the vagrant settings are defined. 
    The "2" represents the version of the configuration format being used (Vagrant 2.x in this case).

2. Box Configuration
        config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
        config.vm.box_version = "20201204.0.0"

    This is where the base box for the virtual machine is defined,
    # config.vm.box_version is optional
    A base box is a pre-packaged virtual machine image. In the example above we are using ubuntu/bionic64

3. Network Configuration
        config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"

    This section configures the networking for the virtual machine (How the VM interacts with the host machine and external networks). In the example above, we're setting up a private network with DHCP, which allows the vm to have it's own IP address on a private network.

        
    1. Forwarded Port Mapping:

        configures port forwarding from the host machine to the guest machine

        The config.vm.network "forwarded_port" directive allows you to map a specific port on the host to a port on the guest.

        # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

        in the example above, accessing "localhost:8080" on the host will access port 80 on the guest machine.

        # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

        in the example above, public access is restricted to the host's IP address "127.0.0.1".

    2. Private Network:

        configures a private network interface for the VM.

        config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.56.16"

        The `config.vm.network "private_network"` directive assigns a private IP address to the VM, allowing host-only communication.

        In the example above, the VM will have the IP address "192.168.56.16" on a private network that is accessible only from the host.

    3. Public Network (Bridged Network):

        configures a public network interface for the VM, usually referred to as a bridged network.

        the `config.vm.network "public_network"` directive creates a public network interface, allowing the VM to appear as a separate device on the network

        Bridged networks make the VM accessible to other devices on the same network as if it were a standalone machine

    port forwarding and private networks are often used for development and testing environments where you want isolated communication. 
    public networks (bridged networks) are useful when you want your VM to be reachable from other devices on your local network.

4. Provider Configuration:
        config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
            vb.memory = "1024"
            vb.cpus = 2
        end

    This is where the provider-specific settings are specified.
    In the example above, we are using VirtualBox as the provider, we can set attributes like memory (vb.memory), CPUs (vb.cpus), etc allocated to the VM.

5. Provisioning: 
        config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
           sudo apt-get update
           sudo apt-get install -y nginx
        SHELL
    This involves setting up the VM after it's booted
    Allows additional provisioners such as Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet, and Salt.

6. Synced Folders:
        config.vm.synced_folder "src/", "/app"
    This involves setting up synced folder, allowing you to share files between host and the VM.

    In the example, the "src/" directory on the host is synced to the "/app" directory on the VM.

7. Custom Scripts:
        config.vm.provision "shell", path: "setup.sh"
    external scripts can be executed during provisioning using this section.
    In the example above "setup.sh"

8. Conditional Configuration:
        if ENV["VAGRANT_ENV"] == "development"
            config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
                vb.memory = "2048"
                vb.cpus = 4
            end
        end
    
    Settings can be Conditionally applied based on environment variables or other conditions. 

    If the "VAGRANT_ENV" environment variable is set to "development" the VM's resources will be increased.
